You can learn about how to protest<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protest-safely-gear-tips/"> here. </a> You can search up "protests near me" or you can hear it from a friend, a groupchat, or a post on social media. The most important thing is to stay hydrated and remain peaceful.  <a href="https://map.wewontgoback.com/?source=ppfa"> Here </a> you can find a nearby rally or protest brought together by Planned Parenthood.

      <div>
      <p class="Voting"> One of the most effective ways to help the cause is to vote. If you are 18 and older, or will be 18 by the time elections roll around, it is important that you vote for the politicians who support your cause and your rights. In this case, it is legal abortion, so vote for politicians who will support legal abortion.
