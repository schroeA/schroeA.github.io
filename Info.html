    <h3>What Is Abortion?</h3>
      <p>Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal of an embryo or fetus.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h3>Why is abortion important?</h3>
      <p>Abortion is important because it a safe way to remove an embryo or fetus when the person doesn't want to be pregnant (maybe because of the lack of resources for them to provide for a kid) or they need an abortion because the pregnancy could kill them. Where abortion is illegal or highly restricted, women resort to unsafe means to end unwanted pregnancies, including self-inflicted abdominal and bodily trauma, ingestion of dangerous chemicals, self-medication with a variety of drugs, and reliance on unqualified abortion providers. Today, approximately 21 million women around the world obtain unsafe, illegal abortions each year, and complications from these unsafe procedures account for approximately 13% of
all maternal deaths, nearly 50,000 annually.</p>

    <h3>Why did Roe v. Wade get overturned?</h3>
      <p>There are lots of different ideas people have about why Roe v. Wade was overturned, but no matter why it was overturned, it shouldn't have been. Roe v. Wade protected many people's rights and it is saddening that is was overturned. </p>

      <h3>Where Is It Illegal?</h3>

    <h3>How could this change my life?</h3>  
      <p>People of color and other marginalized, low-income people will be most affected because they may not have the resources to travel to get an abortion. About half of U.S. states, concentrated in the South and Midwest, have restrictive abortion laws set to go into effect. More than half of the nationâ€™s Black population lives in the South, where women of color, including Hispanic women, make up a significant proportion. The Plains states also have a large Indigenous population. This could change everyone's lives in different ways.
